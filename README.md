# Shopping Cart

This project was built as part of <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-shopping-cart">The Odin Project: React course</a> in order to implement what I've learned about testing, type checking, client-side routing, and fetching data in React.

## Understanding the Problem

Create a mock shopping cart web app.

My app should include:
- A home page
- A shop page
- A navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages
  - It should include a shopping cart icon that displays the number of items currently in the cart. Once a user submits his/her order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.
  - The user should be able to click on the cart to checkout and pay (however, I won't implement that functionality here)
- Card elements for each of my products on the shop page. Each one should include:
  - An input field, which lets a user manually type in the quantity they want to buy
  - Increment and decrement buttons for fine-tuning
  - A title
  - An "Add to cart" button
  - My shop items and related information should be fetched from <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">FakeStore API</a> or something similar

## Plan

Review my <a href="./notes.md">notes</a> to see my planning process.

## TypeScript Refactor

I later came back to this project and refactored it to TypeScript as a way to learn the language.
